Welcome to VETS!! We're so glad to have you!
We're a relaxed, social-first, low-obligation guild, which means everything we do - wars, events, and all that is completely optional. No pressure, ever!

Once you're settled in, you'll have access to our library of teleport scrolls. Feel free to use them anytime, but remember to just pop them back when you're done! And don't forget to swing by our awesome guild island!! (it's definitely worth a visit).

We run a fun new event every week, and they're a great way to earn guild rewards. You can find all the details on our Discord, and of course, they're totally optional, so join in whenever you feel like it!

Most importantly, just be kind, have fun, and try to hop on at least once every two weeks so you don't get marked inactive. But don't worry, if you ever do get kicked for inactivity, you're always welcome back with open arms.

Once again, welcome to VETS! We're excited to have you with us!!!!!

Updated Onboarding:
(Not always relevant to everyone, try to keep casual and condensed so chat doesn't end up flooded or spammed with formality).
- Disinclination to do competitive guilding, wars, etc.
- Focus on community element of things.
- Discord including assorted info and the return (need to ?verify to see).
- What the return is
- (If relevant) how to deal with wynnvets.org/legacy-items
- Rules: please respect the atmosphere, please make sure people you recruit are <2020 and a good fit, please try not to hold a spot while being the least active person in the guild.
- We kick for inactivity prunes (generally people who haven't been seen in 2+ weeks); if that happens, you can always rejoin, no questions asked.

After onboarding, give them wynnvets.org/discord and gu rank username recruiter
